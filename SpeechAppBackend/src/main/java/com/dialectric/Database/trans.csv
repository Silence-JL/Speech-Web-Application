flac,flac3ab1,They live in homes like other Americans and they go to the same schools 
flac,flac3ac2,free time they enjoy the same games and t v programs [noise] that every else does everyone else does  
flac,flac3ad2,many native american children learn about traditions [noise] that people in their families [noise] have had for many generations  
flac,flac3ae2,learn songs stories and dances  
flac,flac3af1,They also learn about special foods and artwork 
flac,flac3ag2,[noise] and they sometimes learn to speak a native american language  
flac,flac3ah2,some people work extra hard to be sure they [noise] their traditions are not forgotten  
flac,flac3ai1,They travel everywhere teaching others about these traditions 
flac,flac3aj2,one native american tradition is totem pole carving  
flac,flac3ak2,[noise] often people pass this tradition down to their children  
flac,flac3al2,children watched the fathers and some [noise] times their grandfathers and great grandfathers carve totem poles  
flac,flac3am1,First they find a tree that can be cut 
flac,flac3an1,They remove the bark from the tree and make it into a pole 
flac,flac3ao1,Then they draw the faces and other markings on the pole 
flac,flac3ap1,Sharp tools are used to carve the pole 
flac,flac3aq2,[noise] they start at the top of the pole and carve down /W AO R D/ to the bottom  
flac,flac3ar2,[noise] when the [begin-noise] /K AA R V/ [end-noise] /IX NG/ is finished the pole is painted [noise]  
flac,flac3as1,Then oil is spread all over the pole

flac,flac3au2,[noise] it takes one month to carve about ten feet of of pole [noise]  
flac,flac3av1,If there are a lot of symbols it may take longer 
flac,flac3aw2,[noise] most totem poles are between thirty and forty feet high

flac,flac3bu2,[noise] for many years the united states and russia [noise] worked separately on going into space  
flac,flac3bv1,The Russians took the lead thirty three years ago by sending the first astronaut into space 
flac,flac3bw2,[noise] after that americans won a first [noise] when neil armstrong walked on the moon  
flac,flac3bx2,[noise] the work needed to achieve these goals has cost the people [noise] of the two countries much money  
flac,flac3by1,Now they cannot spend these large amounts of money for space research 
flac,flac3bz2,because of this the u s and russia will now combine their efforts [noise] with scientists of many countries  
flac,flac3ca2,[noise] they will build a space station [noise] where astronauts from around the world [noise] will be able to live and work  
flac,flac3cb2,[noise] life on space station is very different from what we are used to  
flac,flac3cc2,[noise] most of the difference is because there isn't much gravity in outer space  
flac,flac3cd2,[noise] the force of gravity attracts things [noise] to the /ER S/ surface  
flac,flac3ce2,[noise] without gravity on earth you [noise] would not be able to walk

flac,flac3co2,[noise] the astronauts drink juices and milk from aluminum foil pouches [noise]  
flac,flac3cp2,[noise] the pouches come filled with powder [noise] so they can be stored for long periods of time  
flac,flac3cq2,[noise] when someone wants a drink they add water to the pouch of their choice

mjsd,mjsd3ai2,[noise] they travel everywhere to teach others about their traditions [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3aj2,[noise] one native american /N AH JH IX JH IH N/ [noise] is totem pole carving  
mjsd,mjsd3ak2,[noise] often people pass their traditions [noise] down to their children [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3al2,[noise] the children watched their fathers and sometimes [noise] their grandfathers [noise] and great grandfathers [noise] carve /T AH T EH M/ totem poles [noise] /AH/  
mjsd,mjsd3am2,[noise] first they find a tree that can be cut [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3an2,[noise] they remove the bark from the tree and make it into a pole  
mjsd,mjsd3ao2,[noise] then they draw the faces [noise] and other markings on the pole  
mjsd,mjsd3ap2,[noise] sharp tools are used to carve the pole  
mjsd,mjsd3aq2,they start at the top of the pole [noise] and carve downward to the bottom [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ar2,[noise] when the carving is finished the pole is painted  
mjsd,mjsd3as2,the oil is spread all over the pole [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3at1,The oil is used to keep the pole from cracking 
mjsd,mjsd3au1,It takes one month to carve about ten feet of pole 
mjsd,mjsd3av2,if there [noise] are a lot of symbols it /M/ may take longer [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3aw2,most /T AO T IX M/ poles are between thirty and forty feet high [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ax2,[noise] a family /T OW TH IX N/ pole [noise] may be as high [noise] as ninety feet

mjsd,mjsd3az2,sometimes these animals stand for dances [noise] that people in /N AH/ family liked to do  
mjsd,mjsd3ba2,[noise] at present totem poles are sold [noise] to people [noise] who collect them and to /M Y UW Z AE N Z/ [whisper]  
mjsd,mjsd3bb2,[noise] there was a crime in alaska [noise] where someone [noise] was robbed and harmed  
mjsd,mjsd3bc2,[noise] two boys have been punished for that [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bd2,they are members of the /K L IH NG IH T/ american indian tribe  
mjsd,mjsd3be2,[noise] a judge and the leaders [noise] of the tribe decided together [noise] what the punishment would be  
mjsd,mjsd3bf2,[noise] the boys are being sent [noise] to live alone [noise] on islands of the coast  
mjsd,mjsd3bg2,[noise] each boy will live completely alone for two years  
mjsd,mjsd3bh1,Each has to build a place to live 
mjsd,mjsd3bi2,and they will need [noise] to cut firewood and hunt for food  
mjsd,mjsd3bj2,they will have to find tools [noise] to catch and kill prey  
mjsd,mjsd3bk2,[noise] a tribe leaders [noise] will come to visit from time to time to see if they [noise] are okay  
mjsd,mjsd3bl2,these are the only people they will see [noise] for two years [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bm2,[noise] /CH IY T AX Z/ are the fast /EH M EY/ animals in the world  
mjsd,mjsd3bn2,[noise] scientists say that they [noise] may be extinct soon [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bo2,years ago [noise] they were more than one hundred thousand of them [noise] in parts of africa and asia  
mjsd,mjsd3bp1,Today there are less than ten thousand of them 
mjsd,mjsd3bq2,they are disappearing [noise] because [noise] they land they live on is now beginning [noise] used for farms and factories  
mjsd,mjsd3br2,[noise] they are also killed [noise] by some of the farmers because they kill farm animals [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bs2,some people kill them to get their [noise] skins to make coats /AE N/ other things  
mjsd,mjsd3bt2,[noise] the cheetah babies [noise] are killed by lions [noise] and hyenas [noise] before they are old enough to defend them /S IH L S/  
mjsd,mjsd3bu2,[noise] for many years the /N AY T IX D/ states [noise] and russia worked separately [noise] on going into space [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bv2,[noise] the russians took [noise] the lead thirty /Y IH/ three years ago by sending [noise] the first astronaut into space [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3bw2,after [noise] that americans won a first when neil armstrong walked on the /M/ [cut]  
mjsd,mjsd3bx2,[noise] the work needed [noise] to achieve these goals at has cost the people [noise] of the two countries much money  
mjsd,mjsd3by2,now they cannot spend these large amounts [noise] of money for space research  
mjsd,mjsd3bz2,[noise] because of this [noise] the /Y UW EH S/ and russia [noise] will now [noise] combine their efforts with scientists [noise] of many [begin-noise] countries [end-noise] [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ca2,they will /B UH L DD/ a space station [noise] where astronauts [noise] from around the world [noise] will be able to live /AE N/ work  
mjsd,mjsd3cb2,[noise] life on space station is very different [noise] from what we are used to [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cc2,most of the difference is because [noise] there isn't much gravity in /AA R AH DX AXR/ space [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cd2,[noise] the force of /G R AE V AXR T IY/ attracts things to the earth's surface [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ce2,[noise] without gravity on earth [noise] you would /N/ not be able to walk [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cf2,you might bounce [noise] or you would float [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cg2,[noise] gravity causes several problems in space [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ch2,astronauts don't eat food [noise] that makes crumbs [noise] since they would float around in space stations [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ci2,they use vacuum cleaners to get rid of any crumbs [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cj2,[noise] drops of water in [noise] a shower are also a problem [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ck2,they have a shower /UW M/ [noise] with a door that closes and a vacuum cleaner [noise] to get water off their bodies after they are finished [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cl2,[noise] astronauts drop their feet [noise] to the floor [noise] when they use [noise] the toilet or the shower [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cm2,many /EH N V AY ER M EH N T S/ [noise] make life easier /T/ for astronauts in space [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cn2,[noise] /AE T AXR/ they are used in space [noise] people sometime [noise] find them useful on earth as well  
mjsd,mjsd3co2,[noise] the astronauts drink juice and milk from /AH L UW N IX M AH M/ foil pouches  
mjsd,mjsd3cp2,[noise] the pouches come filled with powder [noise] so they can be stored for long periods of time  
mjsd,mjsd3cq2,/S/ someone wants a drink [noise] they add water to the pouches [noise] of /DH EH R/ choice [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cr2,[noise] the astronauts have always [noise] had very lightweight air supplies  
mjsd,mjsd3cs2,these /S/ air tanks [noise] are now being used here on earth [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ct2,firefighters [noise] used to have [noise] very heavy air tanks [noise] that were difficult to carry around [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cu2,[noise] they were so heavy [noise] that some people /D IH IX N TD/ use /DH AH M/ [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cv2,this was too /D EY N JH R IX S/ [noise] so the astronauts air supply system [noise] is now used  
mjsd,mjsd3cw2,astronauts need drills [noise] that are very /P AW IX F UW L/ [noise] for their work in space  
mjsd,mjsd3cx2,[noise] they have a cordless drill [noise] that runs on batteries [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3cy2,[noise] people on earth now have cordless vacuum cleaners and drills  
mjsd,mjsd3cz2,[noise] a space station has many parts [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3da2,[noise] a space shuttle carries the first [noise] piece of station to its [noise] position in space  
mjsd,mjsd3db2,he astronauts /W AH/ work for five years building the rest of the station  
mjsd,mjsd3dc2,when the station is /F IH N IX S T/ [noise] six astronauts will be able to live there at one time  
mjsd,mjsd3dd2,[noise] most people will say [noise] at that station for about six months [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3de2,[noise] the parts of the /S EY ZH IX N/ [noise] where /DH/ the astronauts live are called the /HH AE P Z/  
mjsd,mjsd3df2,[noise] while at the station they will work on [noise] science experiments every day  
mjsd,mjsd3dg1,There will be three science labs for this 
mjsd,mjsd3dh2,[noise] other experiments will be carried out on outside the station [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3di2,[noise] solar panels will collect the energy necessary [noise] for the /L EH KD T R IH S AX DX Y/ in the space station  
mjsd,mjsd3dj2,[noise] noise is all around /JH Y UW/ [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3dk2,for example things that [noise] make noise every day are alarm clocks hair dryers [noise] fire trucks jet planes and loud music  
mjsd,mjsd3dl2,[noise] but loud noises can be harmful [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3dm2,[noise] too much loud noise can [noise] /HH/ harm /Y ER/ ears  
mjsd,mjsd3dn2,[noise] doctors say more than ten million people [noise] in the /Y UW N AY IX D/ states have hearing problems caused by loud noises  
mjsd,mjsd3do2,some doctors say [noise] they are seeing more /CH IX D R IH N/ with hearing problems of that kind [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3dp2,[noise] some kids in missouri learned that everyday noises [noise] can harm their ears  
mjsd,mjsd3dq2,there were special machines that [noise] kept track of noisy they heard each day  
mjsd,mjsd3dr1,Some noises were very loud 
mjsd,mjsd3ds2,[noise] the sound of kids yelling [noise] on the school bus can be loud enough [noise] to harm kids' ears  
mjsd,mjsd3dt2,[noise] noise made by video games [noise] can do harm also [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3du2,[noise] /Y ER/ ears [noise] pick up sounds made by [noise] many things [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3dv2,the sounds make tiny hairs [noise] deep inside your ear /S/ move  
mjsd,mjsd3dw2,[noise] those hairs [noise] send messages [noise] to your brain [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3dx2,[noise]/then your brain tells you [noise] what sounds /Y ER/ hearing  
mjsd,mjsd3dy2,loud noises can be harm [noise] to tiny hairs inside your ear  
mjsd,mjsd3dz2,noise might make some of those hairs /D/ [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3ea2,[noise] then you can hear as well [noise] as you used to hear [noise]  
mjsd,mjsd3eb2,[noise] one doctor says loud noises [noise] are like strong hurricane [begin-noise] winds [end-noise]
